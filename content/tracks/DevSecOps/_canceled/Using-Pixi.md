This will be a user sessions focused on using Devslop pixi, which means the MEAN Stack, API and Web Service Hacking.

## Topic

Modern applications often use APIs and other micro services to deliver faster and better products and services. However, there are currently few training grounds for security testing in such areas. In comes DevSlop, OWASP's newest project, a collection of DevOps security disasters made as a vulnerable testing and proving ground for developers and security testers alike. DevSlop's Pixi, the first of many entries to come for this OWASP project, will be demonstrated and presenting for participant's hacking and learning pleasure. Pixi consists of vulnerable web services, and participants will be walked through how to exploit several of it's vulnerabilities so they can learn how to do better when they create their own web services and other types of APIs from now on.

### Pixi presentation

There will be a short presentation with an overview of APIs, the MEAN Stack, and why we feel this is important.  Then exercises.

## Target Audience

People who want to learn how to hack APIs and the MEAN Stack
